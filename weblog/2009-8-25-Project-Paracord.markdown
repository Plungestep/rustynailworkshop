About six months ago, I was looking for a good EDC (Every Day Carry) pocket knife.  Every gentleman should have a pocket knife for those random times when something suddenly needs to be cut.  For example, a thread from a piece of clothing.  Eventually I settled on a [Spyderco Spin Etched](http://www.spyderco.com/catalog/details.php?product=273) stainless steel plain edge knife.  The knife alone looked a little naked, so I found a web site that offered paracord fobs for pocket knives.  I purchased one, which complemented the knife very well.  I forgot where I purchased it from, but it was only seven dollars.  For those confused as to what paracord is, it is essentially 4-5 mm parachute cord, containing seven individual strands of rope inside a sheath.  A hundred feet of paracord costs about seven dollars.

Fast forward six months, and I suddenly had the urge to make my own paracord items.  The internet is littered with do-it-yourself instructions and videos on how to make a survival bracelet, belt, dog collar, you name it.  First, I picked up some fake paracord from REI.  After messing around with that for a week, I finally purchased some real paracord from [Supply Captain](https://supplycaptain.com).  I started with HobbitAssasin08’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPO19rXgaIo) on how to create a bracelet with a cobra knot.  He did a good job, and my first paracord item turned out nicely.

I then went on to try a few other paracord items, such as zipper pulls, key chains, a camera strap/lanyard, and even a few cool knots (for the fun of it).

The camera case fob below was made with the (fake) REI paracord.

The key chain below was made using a cobra stitch with a twist.  The twist is just making the cobra stitch on the same side each time, which naturally causes the key chain to twist one direction.

Finally, I had purchased a plastic buckle at REI when I first purchased my fake paracord.  The buckle cost seventy-five cents, and was in the section with the backpacks and straps.  I used this to make a bracelet.  I tried something different by using a double tatted chain or seesaw knot.  It may also be called a zigzag knot, which is a simple pattern of half hitches on each side.
